# Artist Portfolio

This app was built with [Next.js v14](https://nextjs.org/) and [next-sanity](https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity) headless CMS to provide an artist with a more streamlined and less cumbersome self-managed portfolio than their cargo collective account allowed.

# Dependencies

Slick page transition animations.

## [node-mailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) and [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

## [swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper)
Used for the carousel swiper on `page_type === 'about'` pages

## [next-sanity](https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity)
Integrates Sanity's headless CMS with the Next framework
